  <title>Universal Annual Pass Holder Hobby</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1 class="hello-world">Universal Annual Pass holder!</h1>
  <p>One of my other favorite places to have an Annual Pass to is Universal Studios. Going to Universal Studios is
    amazing, I love going to visit the Harry Potter section. Walking up and hearing the Harry Potter theme music makes
    me ecstatic. </p>

  <h2>During The Pandemic</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately with the pandemic, we decided not to have a pass to Universal either to help keep us and our loved
    ones safe. So to keep me in the Universal spirit, this past year I read through the Harry Potter series and
    re-watched all of the Harry Potter movies. </p>
