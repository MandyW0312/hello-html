  <h1 class="hello-world">Disney Annual Pass holder!</h1>
  <p>One of my favorite hobbies is being a Disney Annual Pass holder. Going to Disney always makes me so happy, whether
    we are going for a week vacation or just going for a few hours. Crossing under the Welcome to Walt Disney World sign
    makes my face light up every time as if I am a kid. </p>

  <h2>During The Pandemic</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately with the pandemic, we made the hard decision of letting our Annual Passes expire but I know that one
    day I will be a Disney Annual Pass holder again. During this pandemic, we are getting by with watching a lot of
    movies and shows on Disney+.

  <p>Some of the Disney+ Movies and Shows we have been watching:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Marvel Movies</li>
    <li>Magic of Disney's Animal Kingdom</li>
    <li>One Day at Disney</li>
    <li>Disney Prop Culture</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>Extra Disney Magic</h2>
  <p>You may ask how can being a Disney Annual Pass holder be a hobby, but there are many things that I
    enjoy doing when going going to Disney World that make my experience even better.
  <ul>
    <li>I dress up for Dapper Days or Disney Bounding</li>
    <li>I collect Disney "Ears"</li>
    <li>I Pin Trade with the Cast Members</li>
    <li>I try out the different Restaurants on Disney property</li>
    <li>I enjoy seeing different concerts</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
