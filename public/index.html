    <h1 class="hello-world">Disney Annual Pass Holder!</h1>
    <p>
      One of my favorite hobbies is being a Disney Annual Pass holder. Going to
      Disney always makes me so happy, whether we are going for a week vacation
      or just going for a few hours. Crossing under the Welcome to Walt Disney
      World sign makes my face light up every time as if I am a kid.

    <h2>During The Pandemic</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately with the pandemic, we made the hard decision of letting our
      Annual Passes expire but I know that one day I will be a Disney Annual
      Pass holder again. During this pandemic, we are getting by with watching a
      lot of movies and shows on Disney+.
    </p>
    <div>Some of the Disney+ Movies and Shows we have been watching:</div>
    <ol>
      <li>Marvel Movies</li>
      <li>Magic of Disney's Animal Kingdom</li>
      <li>One Day at Disney</li>
      <li>Disney Prop Culture</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Extra Disney Magic</h2>
    <p>
      You may ask how can being a Disney Annual Pass holder be a hobby, but
      there are many things that I enjoy doing when going going to Disney World
      that make my experience even better.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I dress up for Dapper Days or Disney Bounding</li>

      <li>I try out the different Restaurants on Disney property</li>
      <li>I enjoy seeing different concerts</li>
    </ul>
